Their \"songs\" might be powerful gravitational waves or electromagnetic pulses that resonate across galaxies.  \n","\n","3. **Interdimensional Travelers** ‚Äì In certain sci-fi lore, space whales possess the ability to traverse wormholes, slip between dimensions, or even manipulate spacetime itself. They might be ancient, wise beings that observe civilizations from afar or act as guardians of cosmic balance.  \n","\n","Would you like a specific example from fiction (like *Star Trek‚Äôs* space whales or *Doctor Who‚Äôs* Star Whale)? üöÄüêã\n"]}]}]}
