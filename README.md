# AI in Action â€” Workshop Materials

This repository contains all instructional materials, code, and notes for the **AI in Action** workshop.

Over the course of two sessions, you'll explore how large language models (LLMs) work, how to shape their outputs using prompts, and how to build simple, inspectable workflows that interact with them.

---

## ðŸ“š Workshop Structure

### [Day 1 â†’](./day1/)
- What LLMs are and how they work
- Prompt engineering in natural language
- Hands-on experiments using DeepSeek (chat UI + Python)
- Group formation and project preview

### [Day 2 â†’](./day2/) 
- Building multi-step workflows using [n8n](https://n8n.io/)
- Chunking and rewriting *Moby-Dick*
- Group presentation, voting, and wrap-up

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- A browser
- A DeepSeek API key (provided during the workshop)
- Google account access for Colab (optional, but useful)
- Interest and curiosity â€” no prior coding experience needed

---

## ðŸ§­ Goals

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Understand what a language model is doing when it generates text
- Write effective prompts for different kinds of tasks
- Work with AI using both user interfaces and minimal code
- Collaborate with others to build and explain a multi-step text transformation pipeline

> This repo is designed to be explored â€” you don't need to understand everything at once. Each step builds on the last. Use the README files in each subdirectory to guide your work.
